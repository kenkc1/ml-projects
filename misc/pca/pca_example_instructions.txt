Load the MNIST data set (introduced in Chapter 3) and split it into a training set and a test set (take the first 60,000 instances for training, and the remaining 10,000 for testing). 

Train a Random Forest classifier on the data set and time how long it takes, then evaluate the resulting model on the test set. 

Next, use PCA to reduce the data setâ€™s dimensionality, with an explained variance ratio of 95%. 

Train a new Random Forest classifier on the reduced data set and see how long it takes. 

Was training much faster? 

Next, evaluate the classifier on the test set. 

How does it compare to the previous classifier?
