Continuing with the Olivetti faces data set, train a classifier to predict which person is represented in each picture, and evaluate it on the validation set. 

Next, use K-Means as a dimensionality reduction tool, and train a classifier on the reduced set. 

Search for the number of clusters that allows the classifier to get the best performance.

What performance can you reach? 

What if you append the features from the reduced set to the original features (again, searching for the best number of clusters)?

Provide your answers in the file kmeans_2.py. The code from the previous exercise is available in the files kmeans_1.py and plot_faces_lib.py.
